-- The best way to get two different strings is to use the newStdGen action,
-- which splits our current random generator into two generators.
-- It updates the global random generator with one of them and yields the other as its result.

import           System.Random

main = do
    gen <- getStdGen
    putStrLn $ take 20 (randomRs ('a','z') gen)
    gen' <- newStdGen
    putStrLn $ take 20 (randomRs ('a','z') gen')
    gen'' <- getStdGen
    putStrLn $ take 20 (randomRs ('a', 'z') gen'')

-- Not only do we get a new random generator when we bind newStdGen to something,
-- but the global one gets updated as well.
-- This means that if we do getStdGen again and bind it to something,
-- we’ll get a generator that’s not the same as gen.
